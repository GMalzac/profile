        <h1>Grégoire Malzac</h1>
          <h2>Programmer</h2>
            <p>After 7+ years as a consultant for the banking sector, I needed a fresh new start. Looking for agility and dynamism, I also decided to start working on my own projects. For that I needed a new set of skills : coding !
    After Le Wagon, I aim at working as a freelance developer in the first time to enhance my skills and then, hopefully, launch / join a project as entrepreneur !</p>
